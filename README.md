# Multimodal-3D-Pose-Estimation
This repo combines Udepth and YOLO together to do a 3D pose estimation of objects underwater. This can be an alternative approach to using forward-looking sonar.

## Running YOLO
```
roslaunch yolo_object_detection yolo_inference.launch
```

## Running Udepth
```
roslaunch depth depth.launch
```

## Results
